# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Model Project** and is about the Bain-Sylos-Modigliani model of entry and exit. It is modelled by a two stage game, where firm one chooses produced quantity in stage one and firm 2 chooses whether to enter the market in stage 2.
First we present the model and the necessary assumptions. Then we solve the model both analytically and numerically.

Furthermore, we extend the model by assuming that firm two is already in the market, which is also known as the Stackelberg model.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [EntryExitModel.ipynb](EntryExitModel.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
