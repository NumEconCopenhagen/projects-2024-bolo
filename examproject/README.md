# Exam project

This folder contains the exam project of group Bolo.

In this project we look at 3 problems. In the first problem we look at a production economy and CO2 taxation. In the second problem we consider a career choice model. Lastly, we look at Barycentric interpolation through an algorithm.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [exam_project.ipynb](exam_project.ipynb).


**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, no additional dependencies are required for the project.
