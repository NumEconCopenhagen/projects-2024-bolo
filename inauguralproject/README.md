# Inagural project

This repository contains the inaugural project.

A code is structured to analyze an exchange economy with two consumers, A and B, and two goods, x1 and x2. Exercises are undertaken to understand how the agents' optimal choices change when the object with respect to which they maximise their utility changes, when constraint change, when they become market makers and when a social planner is called to maximise their aggregate utility. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, no additional dependencies are required for the project.
