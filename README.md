This repository contains:  

**1. Inaugural project:**
This inaugural project explores an exchange economy involving two consumers. In the project, we determine the allocation of goods under various circumstances.


**2. Data project:**
Our project is titled Italy, patterns of its Aging problem and is about The demographic changes in Italy. With this project we seek to illustrate how the population of Italy has changed from 1992-2021. To delve deeper into the topic we present data on fertility and life expectancy, which could potentially explain the demographic shift. Furthermore, we want to discuss the possible challenges these demographic changes can have on the Italian pension system. (PAYG). Lastly we show a population projection.


**3. Model project:**
Our project is titled Model Project and is about the Bain-Sylos-Modigliani model of entry and exit. It is modelled by a two stage game, where firm one chooses produced quantity in stage one and firm 2 chooses whether to enter the market in stage 2. First we present the model and the necessary assumptions. Then we solve the model both analytically and numerically.

Furthermore, we extend the model by assuming that firm two is already in the market, which is also known as the Stackelberg model.
